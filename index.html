                <p>   Americans have a long history with cars and have thus formed a relationship dependent on them. Many American cities and towns hinge on cars being the primary mode of transportation–creating a surplus of car-oriented infrastructure. With said infrastructure, it is hard for other modes of transportation like walking, cycling, or other alternatives to flourish. In this text, we look at how car dependency affects the average American family and how to combat it.</p>

            <h1 class="header" id="origins">The Origins</h1>
            <p>    Over time Americans have grown more dependent on cars. Cars were once considered a luxury, but that narrative quickly shifted when Henry Ford installed the first moving assembly line for the mass production of automobiles in 1913. This mass production lowered prices for automobiles and heightened demand. After World War II, urban infrastructure began to be built primarily around cars, promoting more widespread use of automobiles. Still, this infrastructure, or car-centric planning, dominates present-day urban areas privileging the car over other alternatives. Americans are now more dependent on cars than ever before.</P>

        <div class="third_section">
            <h1 class="header" id="social">Social Aspects</h1>
            <p>     In a car-dependent city, there is little room for socialization outside unavoidable interactions such as family, coworkers, or the small window of time spent on errands. Time spent in an automobile, that is, time spent alone is a part of most American daily routines. In a country as big as the United States, commute times to and from work can be around 45 minutes or longer. While this is not a problem for everyone, it can be for those who enjoy those small interactions in everyday life. Public transportation grants more opportunities for interactions with others around you. Such interactions are a reminder that you are here with billions of others. A reminder that you are part of a living world. We should also consider the socialization of people not fortunate enough to have a car. It may be someone too old to drive, someone too young to drive, or someone with a disability. These people will always remain isolated in some way in a car-dependent society. They can not go out and experience what is happening in their community or see the world around them without potentially burdening others for a ride. Using a greater variety of transportation, we can help those less fortunate and encourage getting out of the house more often.</p>

            <h1 class="header" id="health">Health</h1>
            <p>     The health of the individual and the environment are affected by this relationship. In 2021, an estimated 42,915 people died in motor vehicle-related accidents–the highest mortality rate since 2005. Motor vehicle crashes are one of the leading causes of death in America. Automobiles also largely contribute to air pollution by emitting carbon monoxide into the atmosphere when burning fuel. A wide-range of diseases can also result from long-term or short-term exposure to air pollution. Walkable environments can immensely reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote a healthier environment.</p>

            <h1 class="header" id="finance">Finance</h1>
            <p>     Citizens in a car-dependent environment are financially burdened by just owning a car. You must consider insurance costs, car payments, car repairs, and everything else that may come with owning a car. According to AAA’s Your Driving Costs study, the annual cost of car ownership in 2022 was around $10,728. Another cost to consider is taxes. The expenses of building more highways, and maintaining roads or traffic signals, are passed down to the taxpayer. Some families living in a walkable environment may still own a car for specific purposes, but in these cases, a car becomes a luxury and not a necessity.</p>

        <div class="sixth_section">
            <h1 class="header" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
            <p>     Coming to a close, we can see that car-centric infrastructure and car dependency promote all of these effects on the individual, yet, walkable environments promote a more positive community. We should all push for more walkable cities that uplift the needs of the community rather than car-dependent cities that put a strain on those who live within them.</p>
